# Analysis-on-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Low-Impact-Computations

To profile layer-wise time performance, before installing PyTorch, replacing the documents autograd of PyTorch with the files here.
The dataset used in the study is the validation dataset of ILSVRC2012, which is too large to be upload here and can be get easily from website https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/index.php.

Requirements: PyTorch = 1.7.0a0

Todo: For deep neural networks, making layer-wise time performance, layer-wise sparsity with DNNs pretrained on specific dataset.
